gsr_test1_1\
gsr_test1_2_pinching\
gsr_test1_3_deep_breaths\
\
touching fingers of left hand to copper electrodes on paper (pointer and middle finger)\
then repeatedly pinching left arm with right hand, got kind of upset\
then taking deep breaths but still feeling kind of upset about how the sensor might not work and about how i was just hurting myself\
\
gsr_test2_1\
gsr_test2_2_slap_table\
\
electrodes on my left back of shoulder\
was typing in textedit about test descriptions for a while, that seemed to make my gsr level pretty low and steady\
then in the second file, waited quitely for about 20 seconds before slapping the table. didn\'92t seem to notice much response.\
\
why is it often cyclical / kind of like a sine wave? should i filter that out?\
it seems to happen when i watch the graph, but then when i am just here typing the graph kind of flatlines until i look at it again.\
i need to compare with the neulog\'85\

not really doing anything, just sitting listening to Tycho and chillin\

I feel like maybe the electrodes were not making good contact? It was really low and flat but then when i would press the copper against my skin (it felt like it was touching already but push it on harder) then i would start getting spikes. could just be that would stimulate GSR though i dunno. but pressing on my right shoulder did not affect the signal.\

oct16_208_diy.txt\
oct16_208_neulog.csv\
comparing diy gsr sensor and neulog gsr sensor. i don\'92t remember the sample rate of the diy sensor\'85 also the data from that are averaged over the previous 32 values (trailing average of length 32). also tweaked the pots during this test which changed the diy gsr readings\'85\
neulog sample rate: 20 Hz\
\
oct16_228_diy.txt\
oct16_228_neulog.csv\
comparing diy gsr sensor and neulog gsr sensor.\
arduino sample rate: \
plotting the direct sensor values, not a trailing average from the diy sensor\
arduino sample rate: 20Hz\
neulog sample rate: 20Hz\
started the neulog recording slightly before the processing sketch recording\
