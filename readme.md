trying to make my own GSR sensor

code samples and circuit diagrams are adapated from
http://www.chris3000.com/archive/galvanic-skin-response/

there are several parts to this project:
- the circuit
- arduino
- Processing

The arduino reads the sensor values from the circuit and writes them over serial. The Processing script reads the values over serial and plots them.
